# Commodity_Alpha_Engine
This research identifies a clear bifurcation in market efficiency between physical commodities and financialized assets. Using a Recursive Expanding-Window model, we demonstrate that seasonal alpha persists in markets with rigid physical supply constraints (Lumber, Grains), while benchmark equities (Dow Jones) remain seasonally efficient. 

Structural Seasonal Alpha in Physical Commodities
Date: December 31, 2025
Subject: Systematic Seasonal Outperformance in Illiquid Commodity Markets
Key Findings: +8.82% Annualized Alpha (Lumber); Significant efficiency in Equity Benchmarks.
1. Executive Summary
This research identifies a clear bifurcation in market efficiency between physical commodities and financialized assets. Using a Recursive Expanding-Window model, we demonstrate that seasonal alpha persists in markets with rigid physical supply constraints (Lumber, Grains), while benchmark equities (Dow Jones) remain seasonally efficient. The strategy in Lumber produced an 8.82% annualized alpha with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.70 (vs. 0.24 for Buy-and-Hold).
2. Systematic Performance Overview
The following chart illustrates the annualized excess returns (Alpha) generated by the recursive model. Results are filtered by statistical significance ($p < 0.05$), with the Dow Jones included as a control to represent market efficiency.

3. Methodology & Robustness
To eliminate "Backtest Overfitting," the model utilizes a Recursive Walk-Forward Engine:
No Look-Ahead Bias: The model selects the "optimal" seasonal quarter based only on expanding historical data available at the time of the trade.
Out-of-Sample Simulation: Strategies are re-optimized annually, simulating a real-world systematic trading environment.
Statistical Validation: A 2,000-iteration Permutation Test was conducted. The "Big Three" (Lumber, Wheat, Corn) achieved $p = 0.000$, indicating structural patterns rather than stochastic noise.
4. Strategic Thesis
The persistence of alpha in physical commodities is driven by non-arbitrable constraints:
Biological/Harvest Cycles: Fixed production timelines in Grains and Timber cannot respond instantly to price signals.
Storage & Logistics: High carry costs and physical decay prevent financial arbitrageurs from fully smoothing out seasonal price curves.
Commercial Hedging Pressure: Producers and consumers prioritize price certainty over speculative alpha, leaving a "seasonal premium" available for systematic liquidity providers.
5. Conclusion
Systematic seasonal rotation is a viable strategy for enhancing risk-adjusted returns in physical commodity portfolios. By avoiding the noise of highly efficient financial markets and focusing on supply-constrained physicals, investors can capture structural premiums that are uncorrelated with broader equity markets.
